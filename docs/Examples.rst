Proof-of-Concept examples
-------------------------

For certain proof of concepts, we provide Jupyter notebooks, which require
additional dependencies to be installed. This can be achieved by appending
:code:`[examples]` to the install command, e.g.

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install .[examples]

Afterwards you can browser through the following list:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   examples/imagenet_example
   examples/mnist_example
